## Webhooks

| Route | Trigger | Purpose | Services |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| `/api/webhooks/clerk` | User deleted | Cascade delete user data | 🔐 🗄️ |
| `/api/webhooks/stripe` | Payment events | Auction payments, subscriptions | 💰 🗄️ |

**Stripe webhook — subscription handling notes:**
- `customer.subscription.updated` / `customer.subscription.created`: writes `trial_start` and `trial_end` directly from `subscription.trial_start` / `subscription.trial_end` (bypasses `startTrial()` helper so promo trials aren't double-applied)
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`: $0 invoice guard — if `invoice.amount_paid === 0` and the subscription status is `trialing`, skips `upgradeToPremium()` to prevent overwriting the trialing status with active
- `upgradeToPremium()` accepts an optional `isTrialing` param; when true, sets `subscription_status: 'trialing'` instead of `'active'`

---

## Cron Jobs & Scheduled Functions

All cron jobs run as **Netlify Scheduled Functions** (`netlify/functions/`). Each function calls the corresponding `/api/cron/*` route internally.

## Scan Resilience / Multi-Provider Fallback

The `/api/analyze` route uses a provider abstraction layer so that each of the 3 AI calls (image analysis, verification, price estimation) can independently fall back from Gemini to Anthropic when the primary provider fails.

### Architecture

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│  src/lib/aiProvider.ts     │  Orchestrator
│  executeWithFallback()     │
└────────────┬───────────────┘
             │ iterates VISION_PROVIDER_ORDER
             v
┌────────────────────────────┐
│  src/lib/providers/        │
│  ├── types.ts (AIProvider) │  Provider Interface
│  ├── gemini.ts             │  Primary (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
│  └── anthropic.ts          │  Fallback (Claude)
└────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Behaviors

| Behavior | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Provider order | Gemini first, Anthropic fallback (defined in `VISION_PROVIDER_ORDER`) |
| Error classification | `classifyError()` determines retry-on-fallback vs immediate failure |
| Dynamic budget | `getRemainingBudget()` ensures all 3 calls fit within Netlify's 26s limit |
| Per-call fallback | Each of the 3 AI calls can independently fall back without affecting the others |
| Analytics tracking | `scan_analytics` records which provider handled each scan, whether fallback was used, and why |
| Client feedback | Scan page shows "taking longer than usual" message when `_meta.fallbackUsed` is true |

### Test Coverage

| Test File | Tests |
|-----------|-------|
| `src/lib/providers/__tests__/anthropic.test.ts` | Anthropic provider tests |
| `src/lib/providers/__tests__/gemini.test.ts` | Gemini provider tests |
| `src/lib/__tests__/aiProvider.test.ts` | Provider orchestrator tests |
| `src/lib/__tests__/coverHarvest.test.ts` | Cover harvest validation + orchestrator tests |

### Migration

- `supabase/migrations/20260301_scan_analytics_provider.sql` — adds `provider`, `fallback_used`, `fallback_reason` columns to `scan_analytics`
- `supabase/migrations/20260326_cover_harvest.sql` — adds `variant` column + unique index to `cover_images`; adds `cover_harvested` to `scan_analytics`; creates sentinel profile for harvest bot

## Self-Healing Model Pipeline (CI/CD)

A GitHub Actions pipeline that monitors `src/lib/models.ts` and auto-updates Anthropic model IDs when they are deprecated. Runs daily at 6 AM UTC.

### Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/model-health-check.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow (daily schedule + manual trigger) |
| `.github/scripts/read-models.ts` | Reads `MODEL_PRIMARY` and `MODEL_LIGHTWEIGHT` from `src/lib/models.ts` via regex |
| `.github/scripts/probe-model.ts` | Sends a minimal vision API call (1x1 PNG) to verify a model is alive; outputs `healthy`, `deprecated`, or `transient` |
| `.github/scripts/discover-model.ts` | Queries Anthropic's Models API to find the newest model in the same tier (sonnet/opus/haiku) as the deprecated one. Handles minor version bumps (4.0 → 4.5 → 4.6) and legacy `claude-3-haiku` naming, prefers dated snapshots over undated aliases to match the pinning policy, and will not downgrade to older snapshots within the tier |
| `.github/scripts/update-model.ts` | Performs a targeted string replacement in `src/lib/models.ts` (old model ID to new) |
| `.github/scripts/diff-guard.ts` | Guardrail: verifies only `src/lib/models.ts` changed and at most 2 lines were modified |
| `.github/scripts/smoke-test.ts` | Post-deploy verification via `/api/admin/health-check` and site liveness check |
| `.github/scripts/send-alert.ts` | Sends email alerts via Resend (success, failure, rollback, heartbeat) |
| `.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md` | Documents required GitHub repository secrets |

### Guardrails

| Guardrail | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| File scope | Only `src/lib/models.ts` can be modified |
| Line limit | At most 2 lines changed (one per model constant) |
| Test gate | Full `npm test` must pass before commit |
| Smoke test | Production health-check + site liveness after deploy |
| Auto-rollback | `git revert` + push if smoke test fails |
| Concurrency | `cancel-in-progress` prevents overlapping runs |

### Alerting

Email alerts sent via Resend for every outcome:

| Alert Type | When |
|------------|------|
| `heartbeat` | Monday only, both models healthy |
| `success` | Model(s) auto-updated, deployed, smoke test passed |
| `rollback` | Smoke test failed, commit reverted |
| `failure` | Pipeline error, manual intervention needed |

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Probe models + discover replacements |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Send email alerts |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Alert recipient |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Authenticate smoke test against health-check endpoint |

## Pricing Architecture

### Overview

Market pricing is powered exclusively by the **eBay Browse API** (`src/lib/ebayBrowse.ts`). Prices are based on active Buy It Now listings, filtered for outliers, with grade-aware estimates generated from a 9.4 NM baseline.

### Pricing by Entry Path

| Path | Route | eBay Called? | Price Stored? |
|------|-------|:---:|:---:|
| CSV Import | `/api/import-lookup` | No | No |
| Manual Entry | `/api/comic-lookup` | No | No |
| Cover Scan | `/api/analyze` | Yes | Yes |
| Key Hunt | `/api/con-mode-lookup` | Yes | Yes |

**CSV Import & Manual Entry** are metadata-only — they enrich publisher, writer, artist, key info via AI but do not fetch market pricing. The assumption is users know their own prices for these paths.

**Cover Scan & Key Hunt** fetch live eBay pricing as part of their flow.

### How eBay Pricing Works

1. `searchActiveListings()` queries eBay Browse API for up to 30 active Buy It Now listings
2. Search query built from: title + issue number + grade (if slabbed) + grading company
3. Category targeting: eBay category 259104 (comic books) with fallback chain
4. `filterOutliersAndCalculateMedian()` removes prices below 20% or above 300% of median
5. Requires minimum 3 listings after filtering (returns null otherwise)
6. `generateGradeEstimates()` applies multipliers from the 9.4 NM baseline (e.g., 9.8 = 2.5x, 6.0 = 0.35x)

### Price Data Structure

```typescript
priceData: {
  estimatedValue: number | null;      // Median price at detected grade
  recentSales: Array<{                // Sample of active listings
    price: number;
    date: string;
    source: "ebay";
  }>;
  mostRecentSaleDate: string | null;
  gradeEstimates: Array<{             // Prices across grade scale
    grade: number;                     // 9.4, 9.6, 9.8, etc.
    label: string;                     // "Near Mint", "Near Mint+"
    rawValue: number;                  // Price for raw comic
    slabbedValue: number;              // Price for slabbed comic
  }>;
  baseGrade: number;                   // 9.4 for raw estimates
  priceSource: "ebay";
}
```

### Caching Strategy

| Layer | TTL | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **Redis** (eBay price) | 12 hours | Per-query cache keyed by title+issue+grade+slab status |
| **Redis** (no results) | 1 hour | "No data" marker so retries happen sooner |
| **Supabase** (`comic_metadata`) | Indefinite | Shared cache across users; only serves if `priceSource === "ebay"` |
| **Supabase** (`comics.price_data`) | Indefinite | Per-user snapshot at scan time; stale until re-scanned |
| **Redis** (AI analysis) | 30 days | Image hash → cached AI result (pricing still fetched fresh) |

### Key Files

- `src/lib/ebayBrowse.ts` — eBay Browse API client, search, price calculation
- `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` — Cover scan route (pricing at lines ~694-765)
- `src/app/api/con-mode-lookup/route.ts` — Key Hunt route (pricing at lines ~118-143)
- `src/app/api/comic-lookup/route.ts` — Manual entry lookup (no pricing)
- `src/app/api/import-lookup/route.ts` — CSV import lookup (no pricing)
