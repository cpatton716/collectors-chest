## 1. Code Quality & Technical Debt

**Score: 7/10** (up from 4/10)

### Issues Status

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| No test suite (`npm test` fails) | 🟡 Medium | Missing |
| ESLint config | 🟢 Fixed | Working with Next.js defaults |
| Viewport/themeColor metadata | 🟢 Fixed | Migrated to `export const viewport` |
| Stripe webhook config export | 🟢 Fixed | Deprecated config removed |
| TypeScript compilation | 🟢 Passing | Clean |
| Production build | 🟢 Passing | Clean |
| Sentry error tracking | 🟢 Added | Production-ready |
| PostHog analytics | 🟢 Added | Tracking enabled |

### Remaining Work

1. **Add test suite** - Important for preventing regressions

## 2. Security Posture

**Score: 8/10** (up from 6/10)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| RLS policies (core tables) | ✅ Good | Production-ready |
| RLS policies (auction tables) | ✅ Good | Properly configured |
| CCPA deletion webhook | ✅ Good | Clerk webhook exists |

## 3. Auction Feature Evaluation

**Score: 8/10** (up from 7/10)

### What's Working Well
- eBay-style proxy bidding system
- Seller reputation with positive/negative ratings
- Watchlist functionality
- Payment integration via Stripe
- In-app notifications system
- Cron job for processing ended auctions
- Good database schema with RLS
- **Buy Now fixed-price listings** ✅ NEW

### Issues & Gaps

| Issue | Severity | Notes |

4. Hit limit at 5 → sign-up wall (free account gets 10/month)

### What's Working
- Clear value proposition on homepage
- Progressive milestone prompts with benefits
- Well-designed SignUpPromptModal
- Guest scan count visible

### Gaps

| Issue | Status | Impact |

- ✅ Stripe - Payments
- ✅ Anthropic - AI (optimize usage)
- ✅ Upstash Redis - Caching & rate limiting
- ✅ Resend - Email
- ✅ PostHog - Analytics
- ⚠️ Sentry - Error tracking (evaluate usage)

---

### Caching Strategy (Target State)

| Data | Cache Location | TTL | Notes |
|------|----------------|-----|-------|
| eBay prices | Redis only | 24 hours | Remove Supabase cache |
| Comic metadata | Redis | 7 days | Keep existing |
| AI analysis | Redis (by image hash) | 30 days | NEW - add caching |
| Barcode lookups | Redis | 6 months | NEW - immutable data |
| Cert lookups | Redis | Permanent | NEW - certificates don't change |
| User profiles | Redis | 5-10 minutes | NEW - session-level cache |
| Title autocomplete | Redis | 24 hours | NEW - reduce AI calls |

---

### Anthropic API Optimization Details

**Current Flow (4+ calls per scan):**
```
1. Image Analysis (always) - 1024 tokens
2. Creator Lookup (if missing) - 512 tokens
3. Verification (if missing) - 512 tokens
4. Key Info (if not in DB) - 1024 tokens
5. Price Estimation (if eBay fails) - 1024 tokens
```

**Optimized Flow (1-2 calls per scan):**
```
1. Image Analysis (always) - 1024 tokens
2. Combined Verification (if missing) - 512 tokens (merges calls 2+3+4)
3. Price Estimation (if eBay fails) - 512 tokens
```

**Token Allocation Changes:**
| Call | Current max_tokens | Optimized | Actual usage |
|------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Image Analysis | 1024 | 1024 | ~400 tokens |
| Creator Lookup | 512 | MERGED | ~100 tokens |
| Verification | 512 | MERGED | ~150 tokens |
| Key Info | 1024 | MERGED | ~100 tokens |
| Combined Verification | N/A | 512 | ~300 tokens |
| Price Estimation | 1024 | 512 | ~200 tokens |

---

### Database Index Recommendations

Add these indexes for faster queries:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_username ON profiles(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_key_hunt_lists_lookup ON key_hunt_lists(title_normalized, issue_number, user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_hot_books_updated ON hot_books(prices_updated_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_comics_profile_created ON comics(profile_id, created_at);
```

---

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Anthropic cost/scan | $0.015 | $0.008 | Admin usage dashboard |
| Scan response time | 4-8s | 1-2s | PostHog timing events |
| Cache hit rate | ~30% | ~70% | Redis metrics |
| DB queries/session | ~25 | ~5 | Supabase logs |
